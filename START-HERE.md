# 🚀 Starting Your Interactive Setup in Antigravity

## Quick Start (2 steps!)

### Step 1: Add the workflow to your project

1. Create a `.antigravity` folder in your project root (if it doesn't exist)
2. Create a `workflows` subfolder inside it
3. Copy `setup-framework.md` into `.antigravity/workflows/`

```bash
mkdir -p .antigravity/workflows
cp setup-framework.md .antigravity/workflows/
```

### Step 2: Start the workflow in Antigravity

In Antigravity, simply say:

```
"Start the framework setup workflow"
```

or

```
"Let's set up the Universal App Framework"
```

---

## Alternative: Interactive Chat Setup

If you prefer a more conversational approach, you can simply:

1. **Open this project in Antigravity**
2. **Start chatting with me:**

```
"I'm ready to set up the Universal App Framework. 
Can you guide me through it step by step?"
```

I'll walk you through each phase, checking with you before proceeding, and explaining everything along the way.

## What to Expect

### Phase-by-Phase Progression

**Phase 0** (2 min) - I check your environment
- Verify Node, pnpm, Git, GitHub CLI
- Confirm GitHub authentication

**Phase 1** (3 min) - We create the project structure  
- I ask: Project name? Create GitHub repo?
- I create all folders and root configs

**Phase 2** (5 min) - I build the core system
- Create the runtime engine
- Explain key components

**Phase 3** (5 min) - I create your first core (logger)
- Full implementation with examples
- Show how cores work

**Phase 4** (5 min) - I create your first app
- Wire up the logger
- Run it to prove everything works!

**Phase 5** (5 min) - I add development tools
- Environment checker
- Validation scripts
- Handy commands

**Phase 6** (5 min) - We configure the framework
- I ask: What autonomy level?
- Set up git strategy

**Phase 7** (5 min) - I set up MCP servers
- Agent superpowers unlocked!
- GitHub, filesystem, memory integration

**Phase 8** (5 min) - I configure Git
- Create repository (if requested)
- Set up branches
- Initialize automation

**Phase 9** (5 min) - I create directives & dashboard
- Agent procedures
- Human communication hub

**Phase 10** (3 min) - I generate documentation
- README, quick start guide
- Reference materials

**Phase 11** (10 min) - We practice together!
- You give me a simple idea
- I implement it end-to-end
- Shows the whole workflow

**Phase 12** (2 min) - Final verification

## During the Workflow

### What I'll Do
✅ Create all files
✅ Install dependencies
✅ Build packages
✅ Run tests
✅ Verify everything works
✅ Explain as I go
✅ Answer your questions

### What You'll Do  
🎯 Answer a few questions (project name, autonomy level, etc.)
🎯 Approve major phases (quick reviews)
🎯 Choose a practice idea
🎯 Ask questions anytime!

### You Can Always:
- ⏸️ Pause and resume later
- ❓ Ask me to explain anything
- 🔄 Go back and review a phase
- ⏩ Skip explanations if you want to move faster
- 🛑 Stop and explore on your own

---

## After Setup Complete

You'll have:
- ✅ Working framework with example core and app
- ✅ All tools and scripts configured
- ✅ Git repository with proper workflows
- ✅ MCP servers for agent integration
- ✅ Complete documentation
- ✅ Dashboard for human-agent communication

**And most importantly:**
You'll understand how the framework works and be ready to build your own features!

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the workflow in Antigravity"
- Make sure the file is in `.antigravity/workflows/setup-framework.md`
- Restart Antigravity
- Or just start chatting - I can guide you without the formal workflow!

### "I want to start over"
- No problem! Just say "Let's restart the setup"
- I can clean up and start fresh

### "I only want to do part of the setup"
- Absolutely! Tell me which phases you want
- You can skip any phase

### "Something didn't work"
- Tell me what happened
- I'll diagnose and fix it
- We can rollback and try again

## Ready to Start?

Just say one of these in Antigravity:

**Formal workflow:**
```
"Start the framework setup workflow"
```

**Casual conversation:**
```
"I'm ready to set up the Universal App Framework"
```

**Questions first:**
```
"I have some questions about the setup process"
```

**Quick demo:**
```
"Can you show me what the framework does before we set it up?"
```

## Tips for Best Experience

1. **Have 45-60 minutes available** - You can pause, but it's nice to complete in one session
2. **Keep the spec open** - Reference `UNIVERSAL-APP-FRAMEWORK-SPEC.md` if you want details
3. **Ask questions** - I love explaining things!
4. **Don't worry about mistakes** - We can fix or rollback anything
5. **Enjoy the process** - You're about to have AI agents building apps for you! 🎉

**Let's build something amazing together!** 🚀
