# Review Dashboard

This directory contains the Agent Peer Review System dashboard.

## Structure

```
reviews/
├── pending/          # Reviews awaiting reviewer
├── in-progress/      # Reviews being worked on
├── completed/        # Finished reviews (approved/changes_requested)
└── escalated/        # Reviews needing human decision
```

## How It Works

1. **Creator Agent** submits work for review via MCP
2. **Review Coordinator** assigns a reviewer and creates a dashboard file
3. **Reviewer Agent** analyzes and submits feedback
4. Dashboard file moves to appropriate folder based on status

## Review Statuses

| Status | Folder | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `pending` | pending/ | Waiting for reviewer to start |
| `in_progress` | in-progress/ | Reviewer is analyzing |
| `pending_re_review` | pending/ | Awaiting re-review after changes |
| `approved` | completed/ | Ready to merge |
| `changes_requested` | completed/ | Creator needs to revise |
| `rejected` | completed/ | Approach rejected |
| `escalated` | escalated/ | Needs human decision |

## For Humans

Check the `escalated/` folder for reviews needing your decision. Each file includes:
- The disagreement summary
- Both agent positions
- Recommended options
- Timeout information
