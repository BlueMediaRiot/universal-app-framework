# 🎯 What to Do Right Now

## Option 1: Fastest (2 minutes)

1. **Just start chatting with me in Antigravity:**

```
I'm ready to set up the Universal App Framework.
Can you guide me through it step by step?
```

That's it! I'll handle everything from there.

## Option 2: Using the Workflow Files (5 minutes)

1. **Copy the workflow files to your project:**

```bash
# If you're in the folder with the output files
mkdir -p .antigravity/workflows
cp setup-framework.md .antigravity/workflows/
cp setup-framework-workflow.md .antigravity/workflows/
```

Or use the quick setup script:
```bash
chmod +x quick-setup.sh
./quick-setup.sh
```

2. **Open in Antigravity:**

```bash
agy open .
```

3. **Start the workflow:**

Say in Antigravity: `"Start the framework setup workflow"`
